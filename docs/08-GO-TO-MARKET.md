# SwipeForCause — Go-to-Market Playbook

## The Cold Start Problem

SwipeForCause is a two-sided marketplace. Volunteers won't come without content. Nonprofits won't post without volunteers. Solving this chicken-and-egg problem is the single most important pre-launch challenge.

**Strategy: Supply first, then demand.**

Recruit nonprofits first. Get them posting content. Then open the doors to volunteers who arrive to a feed that's already full of compelling opportunities.

---

## Pre-Launch Phase (6-8 Weeks Before Public Launch)

### Step 1: Seed 25-50 Nonprofits

**Target:** Local Charleston area nonprofits first (Jim's home turf = warm connections), then expand to 2-3 additional cities.

**Outreach channels:**
- Direct outreach to local nonprofits Jim knows personally
- Local nonprofit association directories (SC Association of Nonprofit Organizations)
- United Way partner lists
- Community foundation grantee lists
- LinkedIn outreach to nonprofit program managers

**Pitch (keep it simple):**
> "We're launching SwipeForCause — a free platform that helps nonprofits recruit volunteers through short videos. Think TikTok for volunteer recruitment. We're inviting 50 founding organizations to join before our public launch. You'll get early access, setup support, and priority placement in our feed. Interested?"

**Founding org perks:**
- "Founding Organization" badge on profile (permanent)
- Priority feed placement during first 90 days
- Free one-on-one onboarding call to set up profile and first posts
- Direct feedback channel to the product team

**Goal:** 25 orgs verified and actively posting before public launch. Minimum 3 posts per org = 75+ pieces of content in the feed at launch.

### Step 2: Help Orgs Create Content

Most nonprofits have never created short-form video for a platform like this. Provide hands-on support:

**Content creation kit (email + PDF):**
- Quick start guide: "Create your first SwipeForCause post in 10 minutes"
- Video filming tips (lighting, framing, audio, vertical format)
- 5 post templates/ideas:
  1. "Day in the life" — show a typical volunteer session
  2. "Meet our team" — introduce staff and the mission
  3. "Before/after" — show the impact of volunteer work
  4. "We need you" — direct call for help with specific opportunity
  5. "Volunteer spotlight" — feature a past volunteer's experience
- Recommended free tools: CapCut for editing, Canva for image posts

**One-on-one onboarding (for founding orgs):**
- 20-minute video call
- Walk through account setup, first post creation, opportunity listing
- Answer questions, gather feedback

### Step 3: Soft Launch (Invite-Only)

Before going fully public, run a 2-week soft launch:

- Invite 100-200 volunteers (friends, family, local community contacts, social media followers)
- Gather feedback on feed experience, registration flow, and "Volunteer Now" process
- Identify and fix bugs, performance issues, UX confusion
- Collect testimonials and screenshots for public launch marketing

## Launch Phase

### Launch Strategy

**Not a big bang. A rolling wave.**

Week 1: Charleston, SC focus (local press, local nonprofits, local social media)
Week 2-4: Expand to 2-3 additional cities based on nonprofit supply
Month 2-3: Open registration nationally, continue targeted city-by-city nonprofit recruitment

### Launch Day Channels

**Social media (primary channel):**
- Instagram, TikTok, Twitter/X posts announcing the launch
- Short demo video showing the scroll experience
- Partner orgs share launch announcement on their channels (coordinated day)
- Hashtag: #SwipeForCause

**Local press:**
- Press release to Charleston-area media
- Pitch story angle: "Local tech founder creates TikTok-style app to solve volunteer recruitment"
- Outreach to local TV news, Charleston City Paper, Post and Courier

**Community channels:**
- Local subreddits (r/Charleston, r/volunteering, r/nonprofit)
- Facebook community groups
- Nextdoor neighborhoods
- College volunteer clubs and service organizations (College of Charleston, Citadel)

**Product Hunt:**
- Launch on Product Hunt for tech-savvy early adopters
- Coordinate upvotes from network
- Respond to all comments

### Launch Messaging

**For volunteers:**
> "Find your next volunteer opportunity in 30 seconds. SwipeForCause is a free app where you scroll through short videos from local nonprofits and sign up to help with a single tap."

**For nonprofits:**
> "Recruit volunteers with the power of short-form video. SwipeForCause is a free platform where your organization's story reaches people who want to help. Create a post, share your mission, and connect with motivated volunteers."

## Growth Phase (Months 1-6)

### Volunteer Acquisition

**Organic growth loops:**
- "Share this opportunity" feature on each post (generates link with post preview)
- "I volunteered with [Org] through SwipeForCause" shareable badge/story after completing a volunteer session
- SEO: org profile pages and opportunity pages are publicly indexable, targeting "[city] volunteer opportunities" keywords

**Partnerships:**
- College volunteer coordinators (offer SwipeForCause as a tool for finding opportunities)
- Corporate social responsibility programs (companies looking for team volunteer activities)
- Local government volunteer portals (cross-link)

**Content marketing:**
- Blog: "Top 10 volunteer opportunities in [City] this month"
- Social: Repurpose best org videos as SwipeForCause social content (with permission)
- Email: Weekly "Volunteer Spotlight" newsletter featuring top opportunities

### Nonprofit Acquisition

**Scalable outreach:**
- City-by-city launch playbook: identify 50 nonprofits per city, batch outreach, onboard in cohorts
- Referral program: existing orgs invite other orgs, both get "Featured" badge for a week
- Nonprofit conference presence (NTEN, local AFP chapters)
- Integration with existing nonprofit tools (eventually: sync with VolunteerHub, SignUpGenius, etc.)

**Self-serve onboarding:**
- By month 2-3, the onboarding flow should be polished enough that orgs can self-onboard without a call
- In-app tooltips and help docs replace one-on-one support
- Video walkthrough tutorial available on the site

### Key Growth Metrics

| Metric | Month 1 Target | Month 3 Target | Month 6 Target |
|--------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Registered volunteers | 200 | 1,000 | 5,000 |

## City Expansion Playbook

When expanding to a new city:

1. **Research:** Identify 50+ nonprofits in the area, find community leaders and volunteer coordinators
2. **Seed:** Reach out to 50 orgs, aim for 15-20 to sign up. Provide content creation support.
3. **Launch locally:** Social media push targeting the city, local press outreach, community group posts
4. **Sustain:** Monitor engagement, support struggling orgs, feature top-performing content
5. **Evaluate:** After 30 days, assess if the city has enough critical mass (10+ active orgs, 100+ volunteers) to sustain

## Future Monetization Signals to Watch

Not building monetization into MVP, but track signals that inform future pricing:

- **Nonprofit willingness to pay:** After 3 months, survey orgs: "Would you pay $X/month for promoted posts, analytics, or priority placement?"
- **Enterprise interest:** Do large nonprofits or corporate volunteer programs reach out?
- **Engagement tiers:** Do some orgs get dramatically more value? This suggests a premium tier opportunity.
- **Sponsored opportunities:** Do companies want to sponsor/promote specific volunteer events?

Potential monetization models (to explore post-MVP):
- Freemium nonprofit tiers (free basic, paid for analytics/promoted posts/multiple admins)
- Sponsored/promoted posts from larger orgs or corporate partners
- Enterprise API for corporate volunteer programs
- Grant funding (social impact platforms are eligible for various grants)

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Nonprofits don't create content | Provide templates, 1-on-1 support, content creation webinars |
| Content quality is low | Curate feed manually in early days, feature best content, provide filming guides |
| Volunteers sign up but don't follow through | Track show-up rates, implement reminder emails, add calendar integration |
| Platform feels empty in new cities | Don't launch in a city until 10+ orgs are posting, supplement with nearby/remote opportunities |
| Negative press about data/privacy | Publish transparent privacy policy, minimize data collection, be upfront about what's shared |
